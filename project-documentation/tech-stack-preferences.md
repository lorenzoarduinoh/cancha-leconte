# Cancha Leconte - Technology Stack Preferences

## Executive Summary

This document outlines the complete technology stack for the Cancha Leconte web application, a soccer field management system designed for Santiago and Agustin's personal field. The stack prioritizes simplicity, reliability, and rapid development while supporting all required features including WhatsApp notifications and MercadoPago payments for the Argentine market.

## Core Technology Decisions

### Frontend Framework: Next.js 15.4.6
**Selected:** Next.js with TypeScript
