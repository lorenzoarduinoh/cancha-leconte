# Cancha Leconte - Design Documentation

## Project Overview

Cancha Leconte is a web application designed specifically for Santiago and Agustin to organize soccer games with their friends, handle payments through MercadoPago, and track game history. The application serves the Argentine market with Spanish language support and integrates with WhatsApp for notifications.

- **Clear visual hierarchy** guiding user attention
- **Immediate feedback** for all user actions

### 4. Performance Optimization
- **3-second load time** target on 3G connections
- **Minimal data usage** for mobile users
- **Optimized images** and assets
- **Efficient caching** strategies

## User Experience Strategy

### Primary User Journeys

1. **Admin Game Creation**
   - Quick game setup with sensible defaults
   - Immediate shareable link generation
